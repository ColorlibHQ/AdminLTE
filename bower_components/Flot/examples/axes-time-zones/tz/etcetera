# These entries are mostly present for historical reasons, so that
# people in areas not otherwise covered by the tz files could "zic -l"
# to a time zone that was right for their area.  These days, the
# tz files cover almost all the inhabited world, and the only practical
# need now for the entries that are not on UTC are for ships at sea
# that cannot use POSIX TZ settings.

# The following link uses older naming conventions,
# but it belongs here, not in the file `backward',
# as functions like gmtime load the "GMT" file to handle leap seconds properly.
# We want this to work even on installations that omit the other older names.
Link	Etc/GMT				GMT

Link	Etc/UTC				Etc/Universal
Link	Etc/UTC				Etc/Zulu

# We use POSIX-style signs in the Zone names and the output abbreviations,
# even though this is the opposite of what many people expect.
# POSIX has positive signs west of Greenwich, but many people expect
# positive signs east of Greenwich.  For example, TZ='Etc/GMT+4' uses
# the abbreviation "GMT+4" and corresponds to 4 hours behind UTC
# (i.e. west of Greenwich) even though many people would expect it to
# mean 4 hours ahead of UTC (i.e. east of Greenwich).
#
# In the draft 5 of POSIX 1003.1-200x, the angle bracket notation allows for
# TZ='<GMT-4>+4'; if you want time zone abbreviations conforming to
# ISO 8601 you can use TZ='<-0400>+4'.  Thus the commonly-expected
# offset is kept within the angle bracket (and is used for display)
# while the POSIX sign is kept outside the angle bracket (and is used
# for calculation).
#
# Do not use a TZ setting like TZ='GMT+4', which is four hours behind
# GMT but uses the completely misleading abbreviation "GMT".

# Earlier incarnations of this package were not POSIX-compliant,
# and had lines such as
#		Zone	GMT-12		-12	-	GMT-1200
# We did not want things to change quietly if someone accustomed to the old
# way does a
#		zic -l GMT-12
# so we moved the names into the Etc subdirectory.
