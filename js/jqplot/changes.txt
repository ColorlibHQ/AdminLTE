  resizable containers or for changing plot parameters programmatically.

  print correctly.

0.9.5:

* Implemented "zoomProxy".  zoomProxy allows zooming one plot from another 
  such as an overview plot.

* Enhanced cursor plugin with vertical "dataTracking" line.  This is a line
  at the cursor location with a readout of data points at the line location
  which are displayed in the chart legend.

  These include enablePlugins to globally set the default plugin state on/off
  and defaultHeight/defaultWidth to specify default plot height/width.

* Changed targetId property of the plot object so it now includes a "#" before
  the id string.
* Improved tick and body sizing of Open Hi Low Close and candlestick charts.
