# Queensland
#
# From Alex Livingston (1996-11-01):
# I have heard or read more than once that some resort islands off the coast
# of Queensland chose to keep observing daylight-saving time even after
# Queensland ceased to.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):
# IATA SSIM (1993-02/1994-09) say that the Holiday Islands (Hayman, Lindeman,
# Hamilton) observed DST for two years after the rest of Queensland stopped.
# Hamilton is the largest, but there is also a Hamilton in Victoria,
# so use Lindeman.

#
# 3. Interpretation - [snip] "Samoa standard time" in this Act and any

#
# 4. Samoa standard time - (1) Upon the commencement of this Act, Samoa

# Australia

# From Paul Eggert (2005-12-08):
# <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/dst_times.shtml">
# Implementation Dates of Daylight Saving Time within Australia
# </a> summarizes daylight saving issues in Australia.

# From Arthur David Olson (2005-12-12):
# <a href="http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Corporate/ll_agdinfo.nsf/pages/community_relations_daylight_saving">
# Lawlink NSW:Daylight Saving in New South Wales
# </a> covers New South Wales in particular.

# From John Mackin (1991-03-06):
# We in Australia have _never_ referred to DST as `daylight' time.
# It is called `summer' time.  Now by a happy coincidence, `summer'
# and `standard' happen to start with the same letter; hence, the
# abbreviation does _not_ change...
# The legislation does not actually define abbreviations, at least
# in this State, but the abbreviation is just commonly taken to be the
# initials of the phrase, and the legislation here uniformly uses
# the phrase `summer time' and does not use the phrase `daylight
# time'.
# Announcers on the Commonwealth radio network, the ABC (for Australian
# Broadcasting Commission), use the phrases `Eastern Standard Time'
# or `Eastern Summer Time'.  (Note, though, that as I say in the
# current australasia file, there is really no such thing.)  Announcers
# on its overseas service, Radio Australia, use the same phrases
# prefixed by the word `Australian' when referring to local times;
# time announcements on that service, naturally enough, are made in UTC.

# From Arthur David Olson (1992-03-08):
# Given the above, what's chosen for year-round use is:
#	CST	for any place operating at a GMTOFF of 9:30
#	WST	for any place operating at a GMTOFF of 8:00
#	EST	for any place operating at a GMTOFF of 10:00

# From Chuck Soper (2006-06-01):
# I recently found this Australian government web page on time zones:
# <http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia-13time>
# And this government web page lists time zone names and abbreviations:
# <http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/daysavtm.shtml>

# From Paul Eggert (2001-04-05), summarizing a long discussion about "EST"
# versus "AEST" etc.:
#
# I see the following points of dispute:
#
# * How important are unique time zone abbreviations?
#
#   Here I tend to agree with the point (most recently made by Chris
#   Newman) that unique abbreviations should not be essential for proper
#   operation of software.  We have other instances of ambiguity
#   (e.g. "IST" denoting both "Israel Standard Time" and "Indian
#   Standard Time"), and they are not likely to go away any time soon.
#   In the old days, some software mistakenly relied on unique
#   abbreviations, but this is becoming less true with time, and I don't
#   think it's that important to cater to such software these days.
#
#   On the other hand, there is another motivation for unambiguous
#   abbreviations: it cuts down on human confusion.  This is
#   particularly true for Australia, where "EST" can mean one thing for
#   time T and a different thing for time T plus 1 second.
#
# * Does the relevant legislation indicate which abbreviations should be used?
#
#   Here I tend to think that things are a mess, just as they are in
#   many other countries.  We Americans are currently disagreeing about
#   which abbreviation to use for the newly legislated Chamorro Standard
#   Time, for example.
#
#   Personally, I would prefer to use common practice; I would like to
#   refer to legislation only for examples of common practice, or as a
#   tiebreaker.
#
# * Do Australians more often use "Eastern Daylight Time" or "Eastern
#   Summer Time"?  Do they typically prefix the time zone names with
#   the word "Australian"?
#
#   My own impression is that both "Daylight Time" and "Summer Time" are
#   common and are widely understood, but that "Summer Time" is more
#   popular; and that the leading "A" is also common but is omitted more
#   often than not.  I just used AltaVista advanced search and got the
#   following count of page hits:
#
#     1,103 "Eastern Summer Time" AND domain:au
#       971 "Australian Eastern Summer Time" AND domain:au
#       613 "Eastern Daylight Time" AND domain:au
#       127 "Australian Eastern Daylight Time" AND domain:au
#
#   Here "Summer" seems quite a bit more popular than "Daylight",
#   particularly when we know the time zone is Australian and not US,
#   say.  The "Australian" prefix seems to be popular for Eastern Summer
#   Time, but unpopular for Eastern Daylight Time.
#
#   For abbreviations, tools like AltaVista are less useful because of
#   ambiguity.  Many hits are not really time zones, unfortunately, and
#   many hits denote US time zones and not Australian ones.  But here
#   are the hit counts anyway:
#
#     161,304 "EST" and domain:au
#      25,156 "EDT" and domain:au
#      18,263 "AEST" and domain:au
#      10,416 "AEDT" and domain:au
#
#      14,538 "CST" and domain:au
#       5,728 "CDT" and domain:au
#         176 "ACST" and domain:au
#          29 "ACDT" and domain:au
#
#       7,539 "WST" and domain:au
#          68 "AWST" and domain:au
#
#   This data suggest that Australians tend to omit the "A" prefix in
#   practice.  The situation for "ST" versus "DT" is less clear, given
#   the ambiguities involved.
#
# * How do Australians feel about the abbreviations in the tz database?
#
#   If you just count Australians on this list, I count 2 in favor and 3
#   against.  One of the "against" votes (David Keegel) counseled delay,
#   saying that both AEST/AEDT and EST/EST are widely used and
#   understood in Australia.

# From Rives McDow (2002-04-09):
# The most interesting region I have found consists of three towns on the

# much and set the local time 20 hours and 45 minutes from the
# international date line, or right in the middle of the time of South
# Australia and Western Australia....

#
# From Alex Livingston (2006-12-07):
# ... it was just on four years ago that I drove along the Eyre Highway,
# which passes through eastern Western Australia close to the southern
# coast of the continent.
#
# I paid particular attention to the time kept there. There can be no
# dispute that UTC+08:45 was considered "the time" from the border
# village just inside the border with South Australia to as far west
# as just east of Caiguna. There can also be no dispute that Eucla is
# the largest population centre in this zone....
#
# Now that Western Australia is observing daylight saving, the
# question arose whether this part of the state would follow suit. I
# just called the border village and confirmed that indeed they have,
# meaning that they are now observing UTC+09:45.
#
# (2006-12-09):
# I personally doubt that either experimentation with daylight saving
# in WA or its introduction in SA had anything to do with the genesis
# of this time zone.  My hunch is that it's been around since well
# before 1975.  I remember seeing it noted on road maps decades ago.

# From Scott Harrington (2001-08-29):
# On KQED's "City Arts and Lectures" program last night I heard an
# interesting story about daylight savings time.  Dr. John Heilbron was
# discussing his book "The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar
# Observatories"[1], and in particular the Shrine of Remembrance[2] located
# in Melbourne, Australia.
#
# Apparently the shrine's main purpose is a beam of sunlight which
# illuminates a special spot on the floor at the 11th hour of the 11th day
# of the 11th month (Remembrance Day) every year in memory of Australia's
# fallen WWI soldiers.  And if you go there on Nov. 11, at 11am local time,
# you will indeed see the sunbeam illuminate the special spot at the
# expected time.
#
# However, that is only because of some special mirror contraption that had
# to be employed, since due to daylight savings time, the true solar time of
# the remembrance moment occurs one hour later (or earlier?).  Perhaps
# someone with more information on this jury-rig can tell us more.

# Lord Howe Island summer time in 2000/2001 will commence on the same
# date as the rest of NSW (i.e. 2000-08-27).  For your information the
# Lord Howe Island Board (controlling authority for the Island) is
# seeking the community's views on various options for summer time
# arrangements on the Island, e.g. advance clocks by 1 full hour
# instead of only 30 minutes.  [Dependent] on the wishes of residents
# the Board may approach the NSW government to change the existing
# arrangements.  The starting date for summer time on the Island will
# however always coincide with the rest of NSW.

# From James Lonergan, Secretary, Lord Howe Island Board (2000-10-25):
# Lord Howe Island advances clocks by 30 minutes during DST in NSW and retards
# clocks by 30 minutes when DST finishes. Since DST was most recently
# introduced in NSW, the "changeover" time on the Island has been 02:00 as
# shown on clocks on LHI. I guess this means that for 30 minutes at the start
# of DST, LHI is actually 1 hour ahead of the rest of NSW.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# For Lord Howe dates we use Shanks & Pottenger through 1989, and

# Fiji

# Howse writes (p 153) that in 1879 the British governor of Fiji
# enacted an ordinance standardizing the islands on Antipodean Time
# instead of the American system (which was one day behind).

# From Rives McDow (1998-10-08):
# Fiji will introduce DST effective 0200 local time, 1998-11-01
# until 0300 local time 1999-02-28.  Each year the DST period will
# be from the first Sunday in November until the last Sunday in February.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-01-08):
# IATA SSIM (1999-09) says DST ends 0100 local time.  Go with McDow.

# From the BBC World Service (1998-10-31 11:32 UTC):
# The Fijiian government says the main reasons for the time change is to
# improve productivity and reduce road accidents.  But correspondents say it
# also hopes the move will boost Fiji's ability to compete with other pacific
# islands in the effort to attract tourists to witness the dawning of the new
# millenium.

# http://www.fiji.gov.fj/press/2000_09/2000_09_13-05.shtml (2000-09-13)
# reports that Fiji has discontinued DST.

# Kiribati

# From Paul Eggert (1996-01-22):
# Today's _Wall Street Journal_ (page 1) reports that Kiribati
# ``declared it the same day [throughout] the country as of Jan. 1, 1995''
# as part of the competition to be first into the 21st century.


# Kwajalein

# In comp.risks 14.87 (26 August 1993), Peter Neumann writes:
# I wonder what happened in Kwajalein, where there was NO Friday,
# 1993-08-20.  Thursday night at midnight Kwajalein switched sides with
# respect to the International Date Line, to rejoin its fellow islands,
# going from 11:59 p.m. Thursday to 12:00 m. Saturday in a blink.


# N Mariana Is, Guam

# Howse writes (p 153) ``The Spaniards, on the other hand, reached the
# Philippines and the Ladrones from America,'' and implies that the Ladrones
# (now called the Marianas) kept American date for quite some time.
# For now, we assume the Ladrones switched at the same time as the Philippines;
# see Asia/Manila.

# US Public Law 106-564 (2000-12-23) made UTC+10 the official standard time,
# under the name "Chamorro Standard Time".  There is no official abbreviation,
# but Congressman Robert A. Underwood, author of the bill that became law,
# wrote in a press release (2000-12-27) that he will seek the use of "ChST".


# Micronesia

# Alan Eugene Davis writes (1996-03-16),
# ``I am certain, having lived there for the past decade, that "Truk"
# (now properly known as Chuuk) ... is in the time zone GMT+10.''
#
# Shanks & Pottenger write that Truk switched from UTC+10 to UTC+11
# on 1978-10-01; ignore this for now.

# From Paul Eggert (1999-10-29):
# The Federated States of Micronesia Visitors Board writes in
# <a href="http://www.fsmgov.org/info/clocks.html">
# The Federated States of Micronesia - Visitor Information
# </a> (1999-01-26)
# that Truk and Yap are UTC+10, and Ponape and Kosrae are UTC+11.
# We don't know when Kosrae switched from UTC+12; assume January 1 for now.


# Midway

# From Charles T O'Connor, KMTH DJ (1956),
# quoted in the KTMH section of the Radio Heritage Collection
# <http://radiodx.com/spdxr/KMTH.htm> (2002-12-31):
# For the past two months we've been on what is known as Daylight
# Saving Time.  This time has put us on air at 5am in the morning,
# your time down there in New Zealand.  Starting September 2, 1956
# we'll again go back to Standard Time.  This'll mean that we'll go to
# air at 6am your time.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2003-03-23):
# We don't know the date of that quote, but we'll guess they
# started DST on June 3.  Possibly DST was observed other years
# in Midway, but we have no record of it.


# Pitcairn

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-08):
# A Proclamation was signed by the Governor of Pitcairn on the 27th March 1998
# with regard to Pitcairn Standard Time.  The Proclamation is as follows.
#
#	The local time for general purposes in the Islands shall be
#	Co-ordinated Universal time minus 8 hours and shall be known
#	as Pitcairn Standard Time.
#
# ... I have also seen Pitcairn listed as UTC minus 9 hours in several
# references, and can only assume that this was an error in interpretation
# somehow in light of this proclamation.

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-09):
# The Proclamation regarding Pitcairn time came into effect on 27 April 1998
# ... at midnight.

# From Howie Phelps (1999-11-10), who talked to a Pitcairner via shortwave:
# Betty Christian told me yesterday that their local time is the same as
# Pacific Standard Time. They used to be 1/2 hour different from us here in
# Sacramento but it was changed a couple of years ago.


# Samoa

# Howse writes (p 153, citing p 10 of the 1883-11-18 New York Herald)
# that in 1879 the King of Samoa decided to change
# ``the date in his kingdom from the Antipodean to the American system,
# ordaining -- by a masterpiece of diplomatic flattery -- that
# the Fourth of July should be celebrated twice in that year.''


# Tonga

# From Paul Eggert (1996-01-22):
# Today's _Wall Street Journal_ (p 1) reports that ``Tonga has been plotting
# to sneak ahead of [New Zealanders] by introducing daylight-saving time.''
# Since Kiribati has moved the Date Line it's not clear what Tonga will do.

# Don Mundell writes in the 1997-02-20 Tonga Chronicle
# <a href="http://www.tongatapu.net.to/tonga/homeland/timebegins.htm">
# How Tonga became `The Land where Time Begins'
# </a>:

# Until 1941 Tonga maintained a standard time 50 minutes ahead of NZST
# 12 hours and 20 minutes ahead of GMT.  When New Zealand adjusted its
# standard time in 1940s, Tonga had the choice of subtracting from its
# local time to come on the same standard time as New Zealand or of
# advancing its time to maintain the differential of 13 degrees
# (approximately 50 minutes ahead of New Zealand time).
#
# Because His Majesty King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV, then Crown Prince
# Tungi, preferred to ensure Tonga's title as the land where time
# begins, the Legislative Assembly approved the latter change.
#
# But some of the older, more conservative members from the outer
# islands objected. "If at midnight on Dec. 31, we move ahead 40
# minutes, as your Royal Highness wishes, what becomes of the 40
# minutes we have lost?"
#
# The Crown Prince, presented an unanswerable argument: "Remember that
# on the World Day of Prayer, you would be the first people on Earth
# to say your prayers in the morning."

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger say the transition was on 1968-10-01; go with Mundell.

# From Eric Ulevik (1999-05-03):
# Tonga's director of tourism, who is also secretary of the National Millenium
# Committee, has a plan to get Tonga back in front.
# He has proposed a one-off move to tropical daylight saving for Tonga from
# October to March, which has won approval in principle from the Tongan
# Government.

# From Steffen Thorsen (1999-09-09):
# * Tonga will introduce DST in November
#
# I was given this link by John Letts:
# <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/asia-pacific/newsid_424000/424764.stm">
# http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/asia-pacific/newsid_424000/424764.stm
# </a>
#
# I have not been able to find exact dates for the transition in November
# yet. By reading this article it seems like Fiji will be 14 hours ahead
# of UTC as well, but as far as I know Fiji will only be 13 hours ahead
# (12 + 1 hour DST).

# From Arthur David Olson (1999-09-20):
# According to <a href="http://www.tongaonline.com/news/sept1799.html">
# http://www.tongaonline.com/news/sept1799.html
# </a>:
# "Daylight Savings Time will take effect on Oct. 2 through April 15, 2000
# and annually thereafter from the first Saturday in October through the
# third Saturday of April.  Under the system approved by Privy Council on
# Sept. 10, clocks must be turned ahead one hour on the opening day and
# set back an hour on the closing date."
# Alas, no indication of the time of day.

# From Rives McDow (1999-10-06):
# Tonga started its Daylight Saving on Saturday morning October 2nd at 0200am.
# Daylight Saving ends on April 16 at 0300am which is Sunday morning.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2000-10-31):
# Back in March I found a notice on the website http://www.tongaonline.com
# that Tonga changed back to standard time one month early, on March 19
# instead of the original reported date April 16. Unfortunately, the article
# is no longer available on the site, and I did not make a copy of the
# text, and I have forgotten to report it here.
# (Original URL was: http://www.tongaonline.com/news/march162000.htm )

# From Rives McDow (2000-12-01):
# Tonga is observing DST as of 2000-11-04 and will stop on 2001-01-27.

# From Sione Moala-Mafi (2001-09-20) via Rives McDow:
# At 2:00am on the first Sunday of November, the standard time in the Kingdom
# shall be moved forward by one hour to 3:00am.  At 2:00am on the last Sunday
# of January the standard time in the Kingdom shall be moved backward by one
# hour to 1:00am.

# From Pulu 'Anau (2002-11-05):
# The law was for 3 years, supposedly to get renewed.  It wasn't.


# Wake

# From Vernice Anderson, Personal Secretary to Philip Jessup,
# US Ambassador At Large (oral history interview, 1971-02-02):
#
# Saturday, the 14th [of October, 1950] -- ...  The time was all the
# more confusing at that point, because we had crossed the
# International Date Line, thus getting two Sundays.  Furthermore, we
# discovered that Wake Island had two hours of daylight saving time
# making calculation of time in Washington difficult if not almost
# impossible.
#
# http://www.trumanlibrary.org/wake/meeting.htm

# From Paul Eggert (2003-03-23):
# We have no other report of DST in Wake Island, so omit this info for now.

# The International Date Line

# From Gwillim Law (2000-01-03):
#
# The International Date Line is not defined by any international standard,
# convention, or treaty.  Mapmakers are free to draw it as they please.
# Reputable mapmakers will simply ensure that every point of land appears on
# the correct side of the IDL, according to the date legally observed there.
#
# When Kiribati adopted a uniform date in 1995, thereby moving the Phoenix and
# Line Islands to the west side of the IDL (or, if you prefer, moving the IDL
# to the east side of the Phoenix and Line Islands), I suppose that most
# mapmakers redrew the IDL following the boundary of Kiribati.  Even that line
# has a rather arbitrary nature.  The straight-line boundaries between Pacific
# island nations that are shown on many maps are based on an international
# convention, but are not legally binding national borders.... The date is
# governed by the IDL; therefore, even on the high seas, there may be some
# places as late as fourteen hours later than UTC.  And, since the IDL is not
# an international standard, there are some places on the high seas where the
# correct date is ambiguous.

# From Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone> (2005-08-31):
# Before 1920, all ships kept local apparent time on the high seas by setting
# their clocks at night or at the morning sight so that, given the ship's
# speed and direction, it would be 12 o'clock when the Sun crossed the ship's
# meridian (12 o'clock = local apparent noon).  During 1917, at the
# Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea, it was recommended that all
# ships, both military and civilian, should adopt hourly standard time zones
# on the high seas.  Whenever a ship was within the territorial waters of any
# nation it would use that nation's standard time.  The captain was permitted
# to change his ship's clocks at a time of his choice following his ship's
# entry into another zone time--he often chose midnight.  These zones were
# adopted by all major fleets between 1920 and 1925 but not by many
# independent merchant ships until World War II.

# From Paul Eggert, using references suggested by Oscar van Vlijmen
# (2005-03-20):
#
# The American Practical Navigator (2002)
# <http://pollux.nss.nima.mil/pubs/pubs_j_apn_sections.html?rid=187>
# talks only about the 180-degree meridian with respect to ships in
# international waters; it ignores the international date line.
