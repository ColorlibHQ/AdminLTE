# Allowance for leapseconds added to each timezone file.

# The International Earth Rotation Service periodically uses leap seconds
# to keep UTC to within 0.9 s of UT1
# (which measures the true angular orientation of the earth in space); see
# Terry J Quinn, The BIPM and the accurate measure of time,
# Proc IEEE 79, 7 (July 1991), 894-905.
# There were no leap seconds before 1972, because the official mechanism
# accounting for the discrepancy between atomic time and the earth's rotation
# did not exist until the early 1970s.

# The correction (+ or -) is made at the given time, so lines
# will typically look like:
#	Leap	YEAR	MON	DAY	23:59:60	+	R/S
# or
#	Leap	YEAR	MON	DAY	23:59:59	-	R/S

# If the leapsecond is Rolling (R) the given time is local time
# If the leapsecond is Stationary (S) the given time is UTC

# Leap	YEAR	MONTH	DAY	HH:MM:SS	CORR	R/S

# To authorities responsible

# distribution of time
#
#
# UTC TIME STEP
# on the 1st of July 2012
#
#
# A positive leap second will be introduced at the end of June 2012.
# The sequence of dates of the UTC second markers will be:
#
#                          2012 June 30,     23h 59m 59s
#                          2012 June 30,     23h 59m 60s
#                          2012 July  1,      0h  0m  0s
#
# The difference between UTC and the International Atomic Time TAI is:
#
# from 2009 January 1, 0h UTC, to 2012 July 1  0h UTC  : UTC-TAI = - 34s
# from 2012 July 1,    0h UTC, until further notice    : UTC-TAI = - 35s
#
# Leap seconds can be introduced in UTC at the end of the months of December
# or June, depending on the evolution of UT1-TAI. Bulletin C is mailed every
# six months, either to announce a time step in UTC or to confirm that there
# will be no time step at the next possible date.
